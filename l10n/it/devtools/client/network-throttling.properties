# LOCALIZATION NOTE (responsive.noThrottling): UI option in a menu to configure
# network throttling.  This option is the default and disables throttling so you
# just have normal network conditions.  There is not very much room in the UI
# so a short string would be best if possible.
responsive.noThrottling = Nessun limite
